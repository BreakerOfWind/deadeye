1. To play, you need to stay alive for as long as possible. 
2. I recommend having terminal open while you play so you can see the time remaining. 
3. The timer is always counting down, it starts with 5 seconds remaining and if it reaches 0, you die. 
4. When you click the vbux card, your time remaining goes up (3 --> 4).
5. However if you miss, you lose one second (3 --> 2)

Goodluck, it's kind of hard ig (hard like 😏)
